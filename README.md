## Prerequisites
- Linux or Windows.
- Python Python 3.
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN.
- Tested on pytorch >= **1.2**

## Datasets
We use [Places2](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/), [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and [Paris Street-View](https://github.com/pathak22/context-encoder) datasets. To train a model on the full dataset, download datasets from official websites.

Our model is trained on the irregular mask dataset provided by [Liu et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723). You can download publically available Irregular Mask Dataset from their [website](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/partialconv).
